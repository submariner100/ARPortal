# ARPortal
Small App for displaying a Portal
I took this course on Udemy by Parth Anand creating a ARKit portal. The course was very basic and I probalby knew about 98% of 
what was taught. I would like to thank Turbo Squid for supplying me with the 3D images that went along with this project.
The interesting part of the course was using Blender to convert the obj file to dae files. The portal was very basic which was a 
doorway leading into a bedroom, 3D objects used were an TV, bed, table and lamp and a picture. I followed Parth project and gain 
more skills in ARKit.
